# Yang Lab

We are a group of researchers interested in understanding genomic variation	in the context of human health. We have been dedicated to developing statistical methods to make sense of genetic and omics data from large cohorts, with the goal of better diagnosing, treating, and preventing complex diseases.

Our research interests focus primarily on genomic variation and population health, integrating omics data to understand molecular mechanisms underpinning complex traits and diseases, genomic risk prediction, cancer genomics, and bioinformatics software development.
